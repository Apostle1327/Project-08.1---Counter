# A Basic Counter App

This project is a simple counter application built with React and Vite that demonstrates basic state management in React. The counter allows users to increment, decrement (with logic to prevent negative values), and reset the counter value.

## Features

- **Increment & Decrement:**  
  Users can increase or decrease the counter value. The decrement functionality includes a condition to ensure the count never falls below zero.
- **Reset:**  
  A reset button sets the counter back to zero.
- **User-Friendly UI:**  
  The decrement button is disabled when the counter is at zero, providing a clear indication to the user that the counter cannot go negative.
