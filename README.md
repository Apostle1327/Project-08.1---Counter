# A Counter App with Local-Storage bindings.

This project is a simple counter application built with React and Vite, designed to keep track of a numerical value. The counter allows users to increment, decrement, and reset the value.

With integrated local storage functionality, the current counter state is automatically saved, ensuring that the value persists even after refreshing the page or reopening the application.

This project demonstrates efficient state management and local storage usage in React, offering a seamless and persistent user experience.

3. Local Storage Integration: The counter value is automatically saved in the browser's local storage, ensuring it persists across page refreshes or reopening the app.

4. Responsive UI: The app is optimized for different screen sizes, providing a seamless experience across devices.

This project demonstrates core React functionality, local storage usage, and state management for a persistent user experience.
